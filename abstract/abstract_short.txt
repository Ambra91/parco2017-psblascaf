Coarray Fortran (CAF) provides a syntactic extension to easily support parallel programming and  has been incorporated into the standard since Fortran 2008.
In this paper, we will investigate the migration from MPI to CAF of two libraries (PSBLAS and MLD2P4) for the solution of large linear systems of equations using iterative methods and preconditioners. Three main communication patterns have been identified: halo exchange, collective subroutines, and point-to-point communication. 
Furthermore, since PSBLAS and MLD2P4 implement a great number of methods and solvers, we aim at exploring different communication patterns involved in the solution of linear systems. 

We will describe both performance studies and software quality analysis: the preliminary experiments we have conducted for the halo exchange in PSBLAS and using the GNU compiler and the OpenCoarrays library, show that the performances of the two CAF and MPI based implementations are comparable. With further tests we will compare performances of collective subroutines and point-to-point communication, and we will investigate whether a gain in performance can be achieved using other compilers. Additionally, since halo exchange, collective and point-to-point communications are all very common patterns in parallel software, we will describe the best-usage strategies for porting them from MPI to CAF.
